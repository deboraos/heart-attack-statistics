## Resumo:

In Brazil, there are more than 150 thousand cases of heart attack per year, being one of the main causes of mortality in the country. A heart attack is a medical emergency that occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart causing the death of a part of the heart muscle. Thus, the dead muscle cannot pump blood to the heart, weakening it. Genetic factors, biological particularities and unhealthy lifestyle habits are capable of influencing the increased chances of a heart attack. Prevention is the most effective method to contain this pathology since its early identification associated with adequate treatment drastically reduces mortality and morbidity. This study aims to analyze the correlation coefficients in 14 risk variables that influence the probability of having a heart attack in an individual in order to identify whether there is any relationship between the variability of these variables and quantify this relationship through hypotheses.
